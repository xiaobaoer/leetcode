Sum of Two Integers

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

CODE:

public class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        if(a==0){return b;
        }
        if(b==0){return a;
        }
        int sum=a^b;
        int carry=(a&b)<<1;
        return sum+carry;
    }
}
